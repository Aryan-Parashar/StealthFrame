# StealthFrame: Image Steganography Project

## Overview
StealthFrame is an image steganography project designed to enable secure and covert communication by hiding secret messages within images. This project provides users with a comprehensive solution for encoding, transferring, and decoding hidden messages, ensuring confidentiality and privacy in communication.

## Features
- **Image Steganography**: StealthFrame employs advanced techniques to embed secret messages seamlessly within images, making it imperceptible to the human eye. This ensures that the communication remains covert and secure.
- **Encryption Mechanism**: Prior to embedding the secret message into the image, StealthFrame encrypts the message using a symmetric key encryption algorithm. This encryption ensures that only authorized parties with the correct decryption key can access the hidden information.
- **Email-based Transfer**: StealthFrame facilitates the transfer of steganography images via email, leveraging the SMTP protocol for secure communication. This enables users to transmit encoded images to recipients securely, regardless of geographical location.
- **Decryption Mechanism**: Upon receiving a steganography image, recipients can use StealthFrame to decrypt the hidden message. The decryption process involves extracting the encoded message from the image and decrypting it using the appropriate decryption key, ensuring the original message is retrieved accurately.

## Implementation

### Image Steganography
StealthFrame implements image steganography by manipulating the pixel values of the image to embed the secret message. Each character of the message is encoded into the least significant bits of the image pixels, ensuring minimal visual distortion. This process is performed in such a way that the original image remains visually unchanged to maintain the covert nature of communication.

### Encryption Mechanism
Before embedding the secret message into the image, StealthFrame encrypts the message using a symmetric key encryption algorithm. This encryption ensures that the message remains secure even if the steganography image is intercepted by unauthorized parties. StealthFrame allows users to specify the encryption key, providing an additional layer of security.

### Email-based Transfer
StealthFrame enables users to transfer steganography images via email, leveraging the SMTP protocol for secure communication. Users can specify the recipient's email address and send the encoded image as an attachment. This email-based transfer mechanism ensures that the steganography image reaches the intended recipient securely, without the risk of interception.

### Decryption Mechanism
Upon receiving a steganography image, recipients can use StealthFrame to decrypt the hidden message. The decryption process involves extracting the encoded message from the image and decrypting it using the decryption key specified by the sender. StealthFrame ensures that only authorized recipients with the correct decryption key can access the original message, maintaining the confidentiality of communication.
